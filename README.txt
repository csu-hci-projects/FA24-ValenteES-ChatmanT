How HW1 Works:
	In our game, there are 3 separate levels. A menu that has a play button that loads level 1 and a quit button that exits the program. Within Level 1 
	are 3 of each: hazards, targets, health pickups, and ammo pickups. This level shows multiple platforms that must be climbed on to reach
	some of the targets. Once all targets are eliminated level 2 opens. Level 2 also has 3 of each required item but shows a more open landscape with easy 
	access to the target. Finally, after all targets in level 2 are eliminated the menu screen reloads and the player can choose to play again or quit. 
	The only requirement to play this game is to have access to a computer that can open games.
